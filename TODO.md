# Picard Documentation Project TODO list

- Flesh out tag descriptions.  Include examples.

- Add "Best Practices" section
  - Info regarding large libraries (see troubleshooting picard stops working)

- Add "How do I..." section (step-by-step instructions)
  - Submit AcoustID fingerprints (already included in workflows section)
  - Install plugins from files (already included in plugins configuration section)

- Add "Useful links" section?
  - videos
  - scripts

- Add more index items to tags and variables

- Explain context menus
  - left-pane
  - right-pane
  - tags pane

- Add a diagram showing the relationships between Release Groups, Releases, Tracks, Recordings and Works to the Glossary of Terms page or possibly the Introduction page.

- Split the Documentation Credits and Updates page into two - one called "Help Us by Contributing" which encourages users to make contributions to the documentation with a pointer to this page as encouragement by making it easier to decide how, the other called Documentation Credits which is a list of people who have contributed to Picard and / or the documentation as a plaudit.

- Revise the site structure to remove Transifex (which is unsuitable for translating documentation prose rather than application text snippets) and replace it with a structure storing other language versions manually created and maintained (though we could experiment with using Google, Bing or Yandex Translate to automate this process somehow). I like that Bob has named himself editor (of the English version) and think that it would be a good idea to have a named editor for each language version.

- Rename "Configuration" to "Settings" (or "Options" if we want to maintain compatibility with Picards actual terminology).

- Add a screen shot and explanation to the "Configuration" page (similar to the "Main Screen" page).
