msgid ""
"A profile is defined by a set of options it manages.  For example, one "
"profile may include settings for file naming such as the target directory"
" and which file naming script to use, while another profile may include "
"different settings for the same options or different options entirely (or"
" some of each).  Profiles are stacked and processed in the order "
"specified by the user, from top to bottom with the lowest level being the"
" system's \"user settings\" profile.  Each user-defined profile can be "
"enabled or disabled independently from the other user-defined profiles.  "
"The system's \"user settings\" profile is always enabled and includes all"
" options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/user_profiles.rst:18
msgid ""
"When an option value is retrieved as part of Picard's processing, it "
"comes from the first enabled profile in the stack that manages that "
"option.  Similarly, when a new value is set for an option in the "
":menuselection:`Options...` window, the change will only be applied to "
"the first enabled profile in the stack that manages that option."

"Initially, the profile stack contains only the system's \"user settings\""

"For this example, the user would like to define a set of options with "
"alternate values, in this case a target directory where audio files are "
"saved (option ``move_files_to``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/user_profiles.rst:30
msgid ""
"The user creates a new profile (named \"TargetMyDir\"), adds the option "
"``move_files_to`` to it, and enables this profile. The stack is now:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/user_profiles.rst:38
msgid ""
"Since the profile \"TargetMyDir\" is enabled, any change to "
"``move_files_to`` is done within this profile, and \"user settings\" "
"still has the old ``move_files_to`` value."

"Now the user wants to work on another set of music files, wanting to "
"disable ``windows_compatibility`` for this set and save them to the "
"\"not_for_windows\" directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/user_profiles.rst:44
msgid ""
"They create a new profile (named \"ByeByeWin\"), add options "
"``move_files_to`` and ``windows_compatibility``, and enable it. Now the "
"stack looks like:"

msgid ""
"They change the values of ``move_files_to`` (to \"not_for_windows\") and "

" the files are saved to the \"ByeByeWin\" ``move_files_to`` directory, "
"with ``windows_compatibility`` = false."

#: ../../usage/user_profiles.rst:56
msgid ""
"Now the user wants to save files to the \"TargetMyDir\" target directory "
"again, with their usual options.  To do this they simply disable the "
"\"ByeByeWin\" profile (which can later be re-enabled if needed).  The "
"stack looks like:"

"All user profile management is done within the User Profile Editor screen"
" available from the :menuselection:`\"Options --> User Profiles...\"` "

"Initially, the list of profiles will be empty.  To create a new profile "

"options selected for the profile to manage.  To rename the profile, "

"profile` command.  The list of options that the profile is to manage are "

"The profiles stack order can be rearranged either by selecting a profile "
